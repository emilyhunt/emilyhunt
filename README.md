### hey! ✨

I'm an astronomer based in Heidelberg, Germany. I work with Gaia data and open clusters. I mostly use clustering algorithms, supervised machine learning, and statistical inference to analyse and process data. I'm hoping to open source a lot of code from my PhD here in the near future.

I have quite a few side projects here! The main thing I'm working on right now is integrations for the Bluesky social media platform that benefit the astronomy community. This is all happening in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/bluesky-astronomy), with all the code running on the cloud.

Some of my other stuff here includes a Slack bot that can send [status updates about a server's usage](https://github.com/emilyhunt/lsw-slackbot) to a Slack channel, Advent of Code puzzles solved [in your web browser](https://aoc.emilydoesastro.com/) using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/Javascript, and a [Java plugin for Spigot/Minecraft servers](https://github.com/emilyhunt/ScenarioGen) that can be used to script & control events.
