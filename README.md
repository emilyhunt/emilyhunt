### hey! ✨

I'm an astronomer based in Heidelberg, Germany. For my PhD, I'm working with Gaia data and open clusters. I mostly use clustering algorithms, supervised machine learning, and statistical inference to analyse and process data. I'm hoping to open source a lot of code from my PhD here in the near future.

I've also dabbled in some side projects, like: a Slack bot that can send [status updates about a server's usage](https://github.com/emilyhunt/lsw-slackbot) to a Slack channel; Advent of Code puzzles solved [in your web browser](https://aoc.emilydoesastro.com/) using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/Javascript; and a [Java plugin for Spigot/Minecraft servers](https://github.com/emilyhunt/ScenarioGen) that can be used to script & control events 👀

I mostly work with Python, but I also have experience with Javascript (using Svelte), C, C++, and Java. Also HTML and CSS, if they count.
