I'm an astronomer based in Heidelberg, Germany. I use clustering algorithms, supervised machine learning, and statistical inference to analyse and process data. I'm passionate about open-source code!

Current open-source projects:

🔭 [Astronomy on Bluesky](https://github.com/bluesky-astronomy): Bluesky integrations that benefit the Astronomy community

✨ [ocelot](https://github.com/emilyhunt/ocelot): a toolkit for working with star cluster data & models (🆕)

💡 [SmartMultiprocessing](https://github.com/emilyhunt/smartmultiprocessing): my pet project - Python multiprocessing with many extra usability features (🆕)

Some of my other stuff here includes a Slack bot that can send [status updates about a server's usage](https://github.com/emilyhunt/lsw-slackbot) to a Slack channel, Advent of Code puzzles solved [in your web browser](https://aoc.emilydoesastro.com/) using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/Javascript, and a [Java plugin for Spigot/Minecraft servers](https://github.com/emilyhunt/ScenarioGen) that can be used to script & control events.

Most familiar with Python, but also have experience with Javascript (using Svelte & Sveltekit), C/C++, and Java (in that order). When I get the time, I want to learn Rust 🦀.
