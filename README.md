### hey! ✨

I'm an astronomer based in Heidelberg, Germany. For my PhD, I'm working with Gaia data and open clusters. I mostly use clustering algorithms, supervised machine learning, and statistical inference to analyse and process data. I'm hoping to open source a lot of code from my PhD here in the near future.

I've also dabbled in some side projects, like: a Slack bot that can send [status updates about a server's usage](https://github.com/emilyhunt/lsw-slackbot) to a Slack channel; an online plotting tool for [visualising open clusters from your web browser](https://github.com/emilyhunt/open-cluster-plotter) with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) (VERY work in progress); and a [Java plugin for Spigot/Minecraft servers](https://github.com/emilyhunt/ScenarioGen) that can be used to script & control events 👀

I mostly work with Python, but also have experience with C, C++, Java and Javascript (in that order), as well as web scripting stuff like HTML.
