### hey! ✨

I'm an astronomer based in Heidelberg, Germany. For my PhD I'm working with Gaia data and open clusters. I mostly use clustering algorithms, supervised machine learning, and statistical inference to analyse and process data. I'm hoping to open source a lot of code from my PhD here in the near future!

I've also dabbled in some side projects like [a Slack bot](https://github.com/emilyhunt/lsw-slackbot) that can send status updates about a server's usage to a Slack channel, [an online plotting tool](https://github.com/emilyhunt/open-cluster-plotter) for visualising open clusters from your web browser with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) (VERY work in progress), and even a [Java plugin for Spigot/Minecraft servers](https://github.com/emilyhunt/ScenarioGen) that can be used to script & control events 👀

I mostly work with Python, but also have experience with C, C++, Java and Javascript (in that order).
